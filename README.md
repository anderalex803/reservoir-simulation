# reservoir-simulation

## Highly recommended book for reservoir simulation
1. *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach*, by Abou-Kassem et al (2006): A very basic text friendly for beginner in reservoir simulation, discussion in a practical engineering language, not rigidly mathematical
2. *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flows in Porous Media*, by Zhangxin Chen et al (2006): Discusses one by one SPE Projects (SPE 1 to 10)

SPE Projects (Papers and datasets) is [here](http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/)

ECLIPSE datasets [here](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/tree/master/grdecl-datasets)

Exercises using Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox and my first Python reservoir simulators

Go to my Wiki to see the results of my observations from doing MRST simulations
