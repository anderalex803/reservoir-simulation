## Simulator code step-by-step and from scratch

Simulator codes are built based on explanations in *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach* by Abou-Kassem et al. 

> See the Python codes in this folder: [simple-simulator]()

Step-by-step:

1. Flow formulation in a homogeneous 1D, 2D, and 3D reservoir, and single well representation
2. 
3. 

## Highly recommended book for reservoir simulation
1. *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach*, by Abou-Kassem et al (2006): A very basic text friendly for beginner in reservoir simulation, discussion in a practical engineering language, not rigidly mathematical
2. *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flows in Porous Media*, by Zhangxin Chen et al (2006): Discusses one by one SPE Projects (SPE 1 to 10)

## Manuals, documentations, lecture materials
1. [MRST Manual](https://www.sintef.no/contentassets/2551f5f85547478590ceca14bc13ad51/index.html)
2. [Prof. Jon Kleppe](http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/TPG4160/index.html) from NTNU reservoir simulation materials
3. [Prof. John T. Foster](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkCwNnLZnRoaHYFyKTdySDw) from UT Austin reservoir simulation YouTube & pdf materials

## Simulation materials and datasets
1. [SPE Projects](http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/) (papers and datasets)
2. [ECLIPSE datasets](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/tree/master/grdecl-datasets) (from *libecl*)
3. [Open Porous Media datasets](https://github.com/OPM/opm-data) (including Norne & SPE projects data)

## Helpful libraries
1. [libecl](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/libecl) (Forked repo from Equinor)
