## Highly recommended book for reservoir simulation
1. *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach*, by Abou-Kassem et al (2006): A very basic text friendly for beginner in reservoir simulation, discussion in a practical engineering language, not rigidly mathematical
2. *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flows in Porous Media*, by Zhangxin Chen et al (2006): Discusses one by one SPE Projects (SPE 1 to 10)

## Simulation materials and datasets
1. [SPE Projects](http://www.ipt.ntnu.no/~kleppe/pub/SPE-COMPARATIVE/) (papers and datasets)
2. [ECLIPSE datasets](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/tree/master/grdecl-datasets) 

## Helpful libraries
1. [libecl](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/libecl) (Forked repo from Equinor)
2. [pyGRDECL](https://github.com/BinWang0213/PyGRDECL)
3. [eclipsegrdecl2vtk](https://github.com/mvanmoer/eclipsegrdecl2vtk)

## Manuals and documentation
1. [MRST Manual](https://www.sintef.no/contentassets/2551f5f85547478590ceca14bc13ad51/index.html)

## My exercises
1. [MRST](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/tree/master/mrst) Go to my Wiki to see the results of my observations from doing MRST simulations
