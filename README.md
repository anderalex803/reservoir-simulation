## Step-by-Step Simulator (SBS Simulator)

Simulator codes are built based on explanations in *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach* by Abou-Kassem et al. Step-by-step and from scratch. 

See the Python codes in this folder: [sbs-simulator](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/sbs-simulator)

Each step is coded in notebooks. Here are list of the notebooks:

1. Flow formulation in a homogeneous 1D, 2D, and 3D reservoir, and single well representation. [Notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/reservoir-simulation/blob/master/sbs-simulator/reservoir_simulation_unit2.ipynb)
2. Simulation with block-centered grid. 
3. Simulation with point-distributed grid.
4. Well representation in simulation.
5. Single-phase flow simulation.
6. Linearization of flow equation.
7. Basic multi-phase flow simulation.

## Highly recommended book for reservoir simulation
1. *Petroleum Reservoir Simulation: A Basic Approach*, by Abou-Kassem et al (2006): A very basic text friendly for beginner in reservoir simulation, discussion in a practical engineering language, not rigidly mathematical
2. *Computational Methods for Multiphase Flows in Porous Media*, by Zhangxin Chen et al (2006): Discusses one by one SPE Projects (SPE 1 to 10)
